    <div class="description">Wielding a diverse armament of destructive skills, Artificer's strength lies in her devastating offense that can break through even the bulkiest of enemies, aided by the versatile Snapfreeze. However, her power comes at the cost of survivability, as she has no defensive or movement skills aside from her high-flying Ion Surge, so the player must take care to use her mighty skills from a safe distance.
