    <div class="LoreBox"> <p> "A rescue mission?" </p>
        <p>The old man leaned forward, scanning the document slid over his desk. His eyes paused on a collection of words near the bottom: UES Contact Light.</p>    
        <p>"Yes."</p>    
        <p>He continued to read the document. The Safe Travels? For a rescue mission? As one of the few surviving captains of the old colony ships, he knew all the designations by memory - and the Safe Travels was not a rescue ship.</p>  
        <p>"Any armaments?"</p>   
        <p>"No." </p>
        <p>"We'll have to fix that."</p>
        <p>With a sigh, he stood up. His prosthetics tugged at his joints - despite being lighter than his original limbs, they always felt heavy.</p>
        <p>"And let me guess - top secret, right?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>He gave out another sigh - they're always top secret - but a small smile crept onto his face. He glanced up to his old radio helmet. He's been bored in retirement anyways.</p>
