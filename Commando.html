However, that doesn't mean he can't be one of the strongest characters for benefiting from the effects of item stacking, given the speed and high proc coefficient of many of his skills.

<div class="LoreBox"> <p>The soldier ducked, barely getting under cover as the wall behind him exploded. His head was pounding - his muscles aching. But now was not the time for rest.</p>

    <p>He counted the seconds. The mounted missile launchers always took a few seconds to recalibrate, and if he took advantage of that time...</p>
    
    <p>Through the sounds of gunfire and chaos, he heard a small click as the enemy missile platform prepared for a second strike. Recognizing his opportunity, the soldier jumped up from behind the wall and fired his pistol, landing a shot straight between the eyes of the platform’s operator.</p>
    
    <p>His shoulders tightened as he braced for recoil: now was not the time for rest. Glancing down the battlefield, there were only a few more enemy platforms to take, and this front would be secured.</p>
    
    <p>But before he could move to join his platoon, he received a notification on the heads-up display in his helmet.</p>
    
    <p>YOU HAVE BEEN REASSIGNED. REPORT TO COMMAND FOR YOUR NEW ASSIGNMENT.</p>
    
    <p>Looks like the time to rest wasn’t coming any time soon.</p></div>
